    CHANGES IN Evapotranspiration VERSION 1.13

NEW FEATURES
    o  NA
   
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o  Significant speed up for the feature to detect maximum missing data duration in function 'ReadInputs' - tested for a daily dataset over 100 years and achieved a 4-fold speed up than version 1.12.

BUG FIXES
    o  Fixed previous bug that ReadInputs didn't interpolate missing data in 'vs' and 'va'
    
MINOR CHANGES
    o  User manual 'ET.Penman' and 'ET.PenmanMonteith' - specify that 'as' and 'bs' are needed in 'constants' when argument 'solar' = 'cloud'
    o  User manual 'ET.MortonCRAE' and 'ET.MortonCRWE' - does not require 'z' (wind instrument height) in 'constants'
    o  User manual 'climatedata' - subdaily RH has the unit of %
    o  User manual 'constants' - a total of 36 constants instead of 46
    o  Corrected inconsistency: user manual 'ReadInputs' states that the four temperature inputs must be > -50 degC but the code has > -20 degC (-50 degC now used for both)
    
DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT
